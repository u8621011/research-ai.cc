 Tips for getting started:

 1. Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude
 2. Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
 3. Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results
 4. ✔ Run /terminal-setup to set up terminal integration
● Compact summary (ctrl+r to expand)
  ⎿  Read src\css\custom.css (968 lines)
  ⎿  Read src\components\Layout\Footer.tsx (18 lines)
  ⎿  Read src\components\Layout\Navigation.tsx (70 lines)
  ⎿  Read src\components\Layout\FloatingActionButton.tsx (16 lines)
  ⎿  Read src\components\Sections\ServicePreviewSection.tsx (21 lines)
  ⎿  Todo list read (7 items)

● Based on the previous conversation summary, I can see that the footer spacing issue has been addressed with clean CSS implementation in custom.css:271-294.
   The footer now has proper centered alignment with flexbox layout and appropriate spacing between contact links.

  Let me verify the current site status by checking if there are any development servers running and testing the implementation:

● Bash(npm run start)
  ⎿  No (tell Claude what to do differently)
